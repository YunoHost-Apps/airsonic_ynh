# install documentation : https://airsonic.github.io/docs/install/war-standalone/

# Set the location of the standalone war to use
JAVA_JAR=__INSTALL_DIR__/airsonic.war

# Set any java opts separated by spaces
#JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx700m

# Set a different location for airsonic home. 
# If this path is /var/libresonic or even contains "libresonic",
# the data from a previous libresonic can be used as is (i.e. without
# renaming libresonic.properties,db/libresonic*,etc
AIRSONIC_HOME=__INSTALL_DIR__

# Change the port to listen on
PORT=__PORT__

# Change the path that is listened on
CONTEXT_PATH=__PATH__

# Add any java args. These are different than JAVA_OPTS in that 
# they are passed directly to the program. The default is empty:
#JAVA_ARGS=

# Note that there are several settings for spring boot, not explicitly listed
# here, but can be used in either JAVA_OPTS or JAVA_ARGS. The full list
# can be found here: 
# https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.4.5.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#common-application-properties
# For example to set debug across the board:
#JAVA_ARGS=--debug

# Or to change the ip address that is listened on:
#JAVA_ARGS=--server.address=127.0.0.1
